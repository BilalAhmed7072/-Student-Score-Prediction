## Project Overview  
This project aims to predict a student’s final score based on the number of hours they study, using a simple linear regression model.  
The notebook `Student_Score_Prediction.ipynb` walks through dataset loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and final predictions.

## Motivation  
Education analytics can help students and educators identify patterns and make data-driven decisions.  
By predicting student scores from study hours, we demonstrate how even a simple model can provide actionable insights.

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of two columns:  
- `Hours`: Number of hours a student studied  
- `Scores`: Percentage score achieved by the student  

It is assumed the dataset is small and clean, making it ideal for demonstration of regression modelling.

## Methodology  
1. **Load the dataset** into a DataFrame  
2. **Explore and visualise** the data (scatter plot of Hours vs Scores)  
3. **Prepare the data** (split into training and testing sets)  
4. **Build the model**: a linear regression model using scikit-learn  
5. **Evaluate** the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R²  
6. **Make predictions**: e.g., predict score for a student who studies X hours  

## Results  
- A plot shows the regression line fitting the data (Hours vs Scores).  
- The model’s performance on test data is reported (e.g., MAE, R²).  
- Example prediction: For a student studying 9.25 hours/day, the predicted score is ~**X%**.

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BilalAhmed7072/-Student-Score-Prediction.git
````

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd -Student-Score-Prediction
   ```
3. Open the notebook `Student_Score_Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook / VSCode / PyCharm.
4. Run all the cells to reproduce the analysis and view the predictions.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following Python libraries:

* `numpy`
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib` / `seaborn`
* `scikit-learn`
* `jupyter` (or any notebook environment)

You can install the dependencies via:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Future Work

* Expand the dataset to include more features (e.g., previous grades, attendance, study environment).
* Try more advanced regression algorithms (e.g., Ridge, Lasso) or tree-based methods.
* Build a simple web application or API to allow users to input study hours and get predicted scores in real time.
* Analyse how study hours correlate with other factors (e.g., subject difficulty, student demographics).
